# nmag-containers

Towards compilation of Nmag in containers, and subsequent use from inside the
container.

The docker and singularity ubuntu 12.04 containers are in working order.
Execution instructions can be found in their respective directories.

[The other images in `archive` do not work yet. From memory: seems to compile,
but "nsim" doesn't show a python prompt and/or tests fail.]
